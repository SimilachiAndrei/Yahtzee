Yahtzee (https://www.yahtzeemanifesto.com/reinforcement-learning-yahtzee.php)


Requirements:
Implement a system capable of playing Yahtzee and guiding a user through the game. The system must be able to play the game with a human user using different strategies. Key functionalities:
1. The user can ask questions about the game (rules, real-time recommendations, strategy, practice scenarios), and the system will provide relevant answers.
2. Provide a graphical interface. The interface should include at least a display of the dice, the current score, the current selections, and a text dialog area for interacting with the system.
3. Track and remember the user's performance over time (scores, progress) and provide feedback after each game, highlighting good and poor moves according to the system's most effective strategy.
